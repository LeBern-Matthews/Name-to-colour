# Name-to-colour
A program that converts 3 words (names used in this case) into rgb values

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter 3 names.

The program uses the sum of the position of the  letters in the alphabet for each word. As the maximum for an rgb value is 225, if any of the sums are above 225, 226 is removed from the value.

This project was to help me with the map and lambda functions(and because it was fun).
